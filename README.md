# Data-warehouse-project
# 🏗️ Building a modern Data warehouse with SQL server ,including ETL processes and data modeling.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **modern data warehouse** using the **Medallion Architecture** approach — structured in **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers — to enable scalable, efficient, and reliable analytics.

The key components of this project include:

- 🗂️ **Data Architecture**: Designing a robust data platform using a multi-layer architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to ensure data quality, scalability, and performance.
- 🔄 **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from various source systems into the data warehouse using automated workflows.
- 📊 **Data Modeling**: Building optimized **fact** and **dimension** tables to support analytical queries and business intelligence dashboards.

## 🔁 Medallion Architecture

- 🥉 **Bronze Layer** – Raw data ingestion from multiple source systems, stored with minimal transformations.
- 🥈 **Silver Layer** – Data cleansing, standardization, and integration to create a single source of truth.
- 🥇 **Gold Layer** – Business-ready data models, fact tables, and aggregated views for analytics and reporting.

## 📊 Data Modeling

The data model follows a **star schema** design to support efficient analytical queries:

- **Fact Tables** – Contain measurable business events (e.g., transactions, sales, KPIs).
- **Dimension Tables** – Contain descriptive attributes (e.g., customer, time, product, location).
